# Background

This is a project I have created in React using NodeJS that displays the front-end based on my back-end project. My website allows users to view articles, topics and comments posted by other users. A user is able to post/delete a comment only by the logged in user 'weegenbump'. A user can sort articles by comment counts, date created and votes and is able to upvote/downvote articles/comments. 

Links to the hosted version can be found below, where you can also find links to my back-end API.
