# Background

This is a project I have created in React using NodeJS that displays the front-end based on my back-end project. My website allows users to view articles, topics and comments posted by other users. A user is able to post/delete a comment only by the logged in user 'weegenbump'. A user can sort articles by comment counts, date created or votes and is able to upvote/downvote articles/comments. 

Links to the hosted version can be found below, where you can also find links to my back-end API.

# Setting up

You will need to have NodeJs which you can download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Make sure you use version v12.12.0 or later.

Fork this repo and clone it onto your machine.

Once cloned and you have cd into the project, you need to install the dependencies with npm install and then npm start which will host the app on port 3000.
